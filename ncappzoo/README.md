# Neural Compute Application Zoo (NC App Zoo)

Welcome to the Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute App Zoo (NC App Zoo). This repository is a place for any interested developers to share their projects (code and Neural Network content) that make use of the Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick (Intel® Movidius™ NCS) and associated [Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Software Development Kit](http://www.github.com/movidius/ncsdk).
 
The NC App Zoo is a community repository with many content owners and maintainers. All NC App Zoo content is being made available here in a central location for others to download, experiment with, modify, build upon, and learn from.

## NC App Zoo Repository Layout
The NC App Zoo contains the following top-level directories
- **apps** : Applications built to use the Intel Movidius NCS
- **caffe** : Scripts to download caffe models and compile graphs for use with the NCS
- **data** : Data and scripts to download data for use with models and applications that use the NCS
- **tensorflow** : Scripts to download TensorFlow™ models and compile graphs for use with the NCS

The top-level directories above have subdirectories that hold project content. Each of these project subdirectories has one or more owners that assumes responsibility for it. The [OWNERS](OWNERS) file contains the mapping of subdirectory to owner. 

## Contributing to the Neural Compute Application Zoo
The more contributions to the NC App Zoo, the more successful the community will be! We always encourage everyone with Intel Movidius NCS-related content to share by contributing their applications and model-related work to the NC App Zoo. It's easy to do, and if contributing new content, you will be the owner and maintainer of the content.

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for instructions and guidelines for contributing.
